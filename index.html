                    and a man of integrity. If you aren't sure exactly how you want your project to be done,

                <p> Tony has completed thousands of projects over the years from small to large.
                    He has done everything from fireplace installations, showers and backspashes to foot paths, full

                    <p>I had tony do tile work for me years ago, and after over a decade one of the tiles came loose
                        after we dropped a cast iron skillet on it. I called him up and even though his schedule is
                        tight he still made
                        time to come take a look. I plan on hiring him for our next renovation!</p>

                    <p>I knew I wanted our new home to have tile in it but I wasn't sure how I wanted it to look. Tony
                        gave us so
                        many great ideas and even helped us pick our tile design, type and found options for different
                        price points!</p>
